## What's a Data Structure?
<br>

_Data structure_ a named location that can be used to store and organize data. <br>

 Example: __Family tree__, a heirarchy of family relationships. <br>
          __Array__, a collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations <br>
             ` char[] array; ` `'H''e''l''l''o' `


## What's an algorithm?

_Algorithms_: a collection of steps to solve a problem. <br>
Example: __Baking a Pizza__ 
                             1. Heat the oven to 550ºF <br>
                             2. Knead the dough <br> 
                             3. Add topings </span> <b>
        
__Linear search__ one by one, examine the elements of an array to find a value. 
            ` |student1|student2|student3|student4|student5| ` 

## Why learn DS & A? 

1. You'll write code that is both time and memory efficient.
2. Commonly asked questions involve DS&A in coding job interviews.
